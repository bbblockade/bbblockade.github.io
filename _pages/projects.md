### ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection â€“ Deep Learning  
**GitHub Repo**: [Fraud-detection--deep-learning](https://github.com/bbblockade/Fraud-detection--deep-learning)

This project focused on detecting financial fraud using machine learning and deep learning models. It was built as part of a competitive team assignment for a master's-level data science subject.

#### ðŸ§  Summary:
- Trained and compared logistic regression, tree-based models, and deep learning (MLP)
- Performed extensive feature engineering on anonymized transaction data
- Achieved high AUC scores with ensemble models and cross-validation
- Ranked **1st out of 80+ teams** in a 300-student competition at the University of Melbourne

#### ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques:
- Python, Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Feature selection, normalization, early stopping, model tuning
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
