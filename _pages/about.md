I'm **Jiqiang Chen**, a Master of Data Science student at the University of Melbourne. I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and programming, and I enjoy working on applied problems using machine learning and data analysis.

### ðŸ§ª Experience

- **ML/AI Intern â€“ Agriculture Victoria Research**  
  Collected and processed multimodal smart farm data (IoT sensors, eDNA, sound) to build anomaly detection models for beehive health. Communicated findings to bee-keepers, received feedback, and iterated on model design to improve usability.

- **University Casual Tutor â€“ MAST10006 Calculus 2**  
  Supported first-year students in understanding calculus concepts during tutorials and problem classes.

- **VCE Tutor â€“ Maths and Physics**  
  Provided individual tutoring for high school students in VCE Maths and Physics. Several students scored 40+ in their Year 12 exams.

### ðŸŽ“ Education

- **Master of Data Science â€“ University of Melbourne**  
  WAM: 80.9 (H1)  
  Research student under Dr. Mingming Gong, with focus on computer vision and applied machine learning

- **Bachelor of Science (Data Science) â€“ University of Melbourne**  
  WAM: 80.7 (H1)  
  Studied core data science subjects with electives in mathematics and statistics

### ðŸ§  Skills

- **Programming**: Python, R, Java, Shell scripting  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Computer Vision, classical models (SVM, trees, etc.)  
- **Data & Cloud**: Pandas, PySpark, SQL, CouchDB, Plotly, Azure, HPC (Spartan), Linux  
- **Statistics**: Deep understanding of mathematical foundations behind ML models

### ðŸ’¼ Projects

- **3D Long Human Motion Generation**  
  Developed a diffusion-based model for long-term motion prediction. Achieved 10% improvement over existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in research led by Dr. Mingming Gong.

- **Fraud Detection Model**  
  Led a group project that won **1st place** among 80+ teams in a university ML competition. Built and tuned models for detecting financial fraud.

- **Anomaly Detection for Beehive Health**  
  Designed and delivered an ML model to detect anomalies in beehive health using multimodal data. Received positive feedback from field collaborators.
