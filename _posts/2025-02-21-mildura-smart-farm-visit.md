One of the highlights of my internship with **Agriculture Victoria** was our field trip to the **Smart Farm in Mildura**, where we presented our data-driven beehive monitoring system to real-world users: beekeepers and farm staff.

This project brought together **machine learning, acoustic and sensor data, and real-world agricultural practice** — and the trip gave me my first opportunity to demonstrate our tools directly to stakeholders who would actually use them.

### 🐝 Beekeepers + Data Science = Real Impact

We presented an **interactive dashboard** that visualises beehive health and highlights abnormal activity using machine learning. Built in Python with Dash and Plotly, it integrates multiple data sources like temperature, humidity, sound intensity, and chemical spray records.

The dashboard lets users explore hive data by site, date, and hive, and overlays model predictions to flag possible stress or disease events.

Seeing **beekeepers engage with the tool in person** was incredibly rewarding. They asked practical questions, gave suggestions on usability, and confirmed that the visualisations helped them validate what they were already seeing in the field.

### 🌾 Hands-On Farm Experience

### 🌾 Hands-On Farm Experience

Beyond the presentation, we also got involved in hands-on work at the Smart Farm — including helping troubleshoot a **pipe blockage issue** by manually adjusting valves across the site.

While on-site, I also had the chance to **drive a farm buggy**, which was fun.

### 🔍 What I Learned

This field trip grounded everything I’d been building during the internship. I learned:
- How to **present technical tools** to non-technical users
- The value of **feedback from domain experts**
- That real-world validation is just as important as model accuracy

It also made me realise how powerful data science can be when it’s **applied in context — with the people and problems it’s meant to serve**.

### 🙏 Thank You

A huge thanks to **Dr. Arbind**, **Kieran Murphy**, **Ronny Chen**, and the Agriculture Victoria researchers and beekeepers who welcomed us to the farm.
